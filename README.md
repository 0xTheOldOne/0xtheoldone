  <p>In real life, i work as a senior software developer/technical expert for a 5000+ employees group.</p>
  <p>I used to work with different companies in various domains such as industry, defense, railway and aeronautics.</p>
  <p>Also, i love to share my knowledge with other people, that's why I taught the basics of C# at the university, in parallel with my work, for a few years.</p>
  <p>Every piece of software that i build is coded with :heart:, i hope that you will like what's you'll find inside my public repositories, event if i don't have a lot of things to share for the moment since i started using GitHub not too long ago ago...</p>
