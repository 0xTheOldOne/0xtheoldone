<div>
  <p>In real life, i work as a senior software developer/technical expert for a 5000+ employees group.</p>
  <p>I used to work with different companies in various domains such as industry, defense, railway and aeronautics. Keep in mind that everything that you will see on this github is part of personal projects and nothing was used at work.</p>
  <p>Also, i love to share my knowledge with other people, that's why I taught the basics of C# at the university, in parallel with my work, for a few years.</p>
</div>

<div class="mb-5">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Every piece of software that i build is coded with :heart:, i hope that you will like what you'll find inside my public repositories, event if i don't have a lot of things to share for the moment since i started using GitHub not too long ago...</p>
